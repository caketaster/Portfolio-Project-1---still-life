On the advice of my mentor I decided to use flexbox rather than floats, so made use of YouTube tutorials to give myself the knowledge to use them.

Flexbox tutorial series:

For the Gallery page I again used flexbox for a gallery responsive to different image dimensions with the help of the following website:

I used W3schools for the basics of making text (or number) boxes appear upon hover for the Gallery page:

issues: 

1 top menu spacing seems uneven (due to different word lengths?)
2 cover-text not centered vertically, uneven space comparing top and bottom padding
2.1 likewise the cover numbers on the Gallery page
3 logo breaks when screen shrinks - using <br> in html and it's ugly and inefficient - need a solution
4 socials now on each page, decided (almost certainly) to have a Form page to submit quries to buy prints etc. (this will be the Contact page). Basket page to be binned.
5 still unsure what happens when you click an image..? Fills screen ideally. And what info is there? - add to query, close image, next image, ..? User can contact me about specific image(s)? 
6 still unsure of the purpose of the site haha. Maybe can select images then send email referencing each image clicked
7 the gallery images don't always keep their correct dimensions, it depends on the page size. annoying.
