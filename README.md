On the advice of my mentor I decided to use flexbox rather than floats, so made use of YouTube tutorials to give myself the knowledge to use them.

Flexbox tutorial series:

issues: 

1 menu spacing seems uneven (due to different word lengths?)
2 cover-text not centered vertically, uneven space comparing top and bottom padding
3 logo breaks when screen shrinks - using <br> in html and it's ugly and inefficient - need a solution
4 considering putting contact info on homepage and not having a dedicated contact page. Contact info: Flickr, email, ...?
5 still unsure what happens when you click an image..? Fills screen ideally. And what info is there? - add to query, close image, next image, ..? User can contact me about specific image(s)? 
6 in which case, do I even need a Basket page? Maybe clicking an image takes you to a contact form (options for print, other queries)
7 still unsure of the purpose of the site haha. Maybe can select images then send email referencing each image clicked
